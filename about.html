            <p id="content-two"><img src="JJS.jpg" alt="johnson" class="about-img">Hello! I’m a tech enthusiast born and raised in India. My passion for technology started at a young age, and over the years, it has only grown stronger. As a fresher, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and explore the evolving world of modern technology. I have a natural curiosity that pushes me to dive deep into various tech fields, from software development to ethical hacking.
    
                I’ve honed my skills in coding and hacking, gaining hands-on experience through various projects and challenges. I believe that understanding both the constructive and deconstructive sides of technology—building and breaking things—is key to mastering the craft. This curiosity extends to learning about modern innovations like drone building, which has become one of my favorite projects.
                
                <br><br>Outside of technology, I also enjoy crafty works and hands-on tasks, finding joy in creating and perfecting things. I am highly dedicated to any task I undertake, putting in the effort and attention needed to ensure quality results. I aim to become a successful tech professional, using my computer knowledge and problem-solving skills to make a significant impact in the industry.
                
                <br><br>My ultimate goal is to stay at the forefront of technological advancements, continuously learning and growing, while using my skills to innovate and inspire others.
